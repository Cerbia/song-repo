            <h1>Pink Floyd - Wish you were here</h1>
            <p> 
                So, so you think you can tell<br>
                Heaven from Hell,<br>
                Blue skies from pain.<br>
                Can you tell a green field<br>
                From a cold steel rail?<br>
                A smile from a veil?<br>
                Do you think you can tell?
            </p>
            <p> 
                Did they get you to trade<br>
                Your heroes for ghosts?<br>
                Hot ashes for trees?<br>
                Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
                Cold comfort for change?<br>
                Did you exchange<br>
                A walk on part in the war,<br>
                For a lead role in a cage?
            </p>
            <p>
                How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br>
                We're just two lost souls<br>
                Swimming in a fish bowl,<br>
                Year after year,<br>
                Running over the same old ground.<br>
                What have we found<br>
                The same old fears.<br>
                Wish you were here.<br>
            </p>
