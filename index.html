            <p> So, so you think you can tell<br>
                Heaven from Hell,<br>
                Blue skies from pain.<br>
                Can you tell a green field<br>
                From a cold steel rail?<br>
                A smile from a veil?<br>
                Do you think you can tell?</p>
